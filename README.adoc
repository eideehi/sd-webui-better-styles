= Better Styles

Better Styles is an extension of https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui[Stable Diffusion web UI] that improves the user interface for managing styles.

English | link:docs/README-ja.adoc[æ—¥æœ¬èªž]

== Overview
Better Styles is a GUI for managing styles that has a UI similar to Extra networks' gallery. While the original Styles feature can only save prompts and negative prompts, Better Styles can save parameters such as "Sampling method" and "CFG Scale" as styles. Additionally, by setting a thumbnail for each style like in Extra networks' UI, you can handle styles intuitively.

==== Style name (required)

Enter the group to which the style belongs. The default value is the currently selected group.

==== Prompt
Enter the prompt you want to save as a style. The default value is the value currently entered in the prompt area. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to include a prompt for the style.
