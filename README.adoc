= Better Styles

Better Styles is an extension of https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui[Stable Diffusion web UI] that improves the user interface for managing styles.

English | link:docs/README-ja.adoc[Êó•Êú¨Ë™û]

== Overview
Better Styles is a GUI for managing styles that has a UI similar to Extra networks' gallery. While the original Styles feature can only save prompts and negative prompts, Better Styles can save parameters such as "Sampling method" and "CFG Scale" as styles. Additionally, by setting a thumbnail for each style like in Extra networks' UI, you can handle styles intuitively.

Style name (required)::
Enter a name for the style you want to save. Be careful not to give it a long name, as it may be abbreviated in the list. If you enter a name that is the same as an existing style, you can overwrite that style.

Group (required)::
Enter the group to which the style belongs. The default value is the currently selected group.

Prompt::
Enter the prompt you want to save as a style. The default value is the value currently entered in the prompt area. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to include a prompt for the style.

Negative prompt::
Enter the negative prompt you want to save as a style. The default value is the value currently entered in the negative prompt area. You can leave this field blank if you don't want to include a negative prompt for the style.

Make this style exclusive to the current checkpoint::
Choose whether to make this style exclusive to the currently loaded model. If you make it an exclusive style, it will not be displayed in the list if another model is loaded.

Use the current image as a thumbnail::
Choose whether to use the currently selected image as the thumbnail for this style. This item will be disabled if no image is selected.
